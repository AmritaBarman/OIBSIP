This GitHub repository documents my one-month internship in Data Analytics at Oasis Infobyte. Within this repository, I have detailed a series of projects that I successfully completed during my internship program. These tasks collectively showcase my efforts and achievements throughout this period. All projects were implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook.I have given a brief description of the projects I completed below:-

Project 1: This project involved cleaning and exploring a retail sales dataset. I performed time series analysis and analyzed customer demographics using various plots. Key insights were drawn regarding sales trends, customer behavior, and correlations, along with actionable recommendations to enhance and stabilize sales.

Project 2: In this project, I cleaned and explored customer data, addressing outliers and conducting customer segmentation using K-means clustering. Key features such as income, spending patterns, and recency were utilized, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for visualization. I provided insights and recommendations based on the characteristics of each cluster.

Project 3: This project focused on cleaning and standardizing a dataset that contained inconsistent and corrupted entries. Key steps included handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting negative and extreme values through outlier detection, and ensuring data integrity for reliable analysis.
